# AdeptiScanner-GI
OCR-based inventory scanner for Genshin Impact, with both a manual and automatic mode.

### _Please read instructions below before using. Download link for the latest version can be found [here](https://github.com/D1firehail/AdeptiScanner-GI/releases)_

AdeptiScanner requires some tools produced by Microsoft to work, they're commonly used in games so you're likely to already have them.
 - If the scanner throws an error on startup, you may be missing them. [Download links for their installers can be found here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170#visual-studio-2015-2017-2019-and-2022). ***You need both x86 and x64***

## Warnings and important notes
- ***For the automated scanning mode of this program to work, it needs to run as admin.***
- While using the auto mode, the program will take control of your mouse. You can press escape during the scan to pause it. Do not move or use your mouse during auto unless paused.
- According to my interpretation of the [Genshin TOS](https://genshin.mihoyo.com/en/company/terms), use of this scanner should be allowed as I do not believe it causes an unfair competitive advantage. To my knowledge, nobody has gotten in trouble for the use of this or similar programs so far, but if you're worried about it I suggest avoiding the auto mode.
- AdeptiScanner relies on specific colour values to identify the contents of the image
    - Anything that changes in-game colours can mess up the results. Examples of programs/features that can interfere is Reshade, Windows Night Light, F.lux, Nvidia Filters and Colourblind compensation tools.

## Updating for a new version
- There's an optional in-app update checker, which can notify you of game data updates and scanner updates
  - Game data updates can be handled with a single click
  - Scanner updates will open the download page for the new version, and export your settings so the new version can import them next time you run it
- You can manually update game data by replacing the `ArtifactInfo.json` file inside `ScannerFiles`with an updated one. Latest version can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/D1firehail/AdeptiScanner-GI/master/AdeptiScanner%20GI/ScannerFiles/ArtifactInfo.json)

## How to prepare for scanning
1. Setting the game to windowed mode with a resolution of 1600x900 is recommended, but not required
   - Other aspect ratios and resolutions are likely to work, but not tested to the same degree
   - Fullscreen mode works, but requires the `Advanced ` -> `Process handle features` setting to be enabled (**Enabled by default**)
2. Open the artifact section on your main backpack and select a 5 star artifact with a full length item description
3. Press "Capture"
    - Make sure the preview matches the good example, if it doesn't, try moving your camera around a bit in-game to change the background and repeat again from step 2 ![something like this](https://github.com/D1firehail/AdeptiScanner-GI/blob/master/Capture-example.png?raw=true)
5. Enter your in-game name / traveler name in the `Traveler Name` text box.
    - Not entering this will cause any scanned artifacts that are equipped on your Traveler to be incorrectly detected as either equipped on the wrong character or not equipped at all
    - There is an equivalent setting for Wanderer name

You're now ready for manual or automatic artifact scanning

### Manual scanning
1. Follow the instructions under `How to prepare for scanning`. Do not move the game window and do not cover the captured area while scanning
2. Select the artifact you wish to scan and press the `Read Stats` button
    - The scanner is mainly tested for 4 and 5 star artifacts. While it has the information about all tiers of artifacts, it may be unable to read some lower tier ones
3. Repeat step 2 for every artifact you wish to manually scan

### Automated scanning
- While using the auto mode, the program will take control of your mouse. You can press escape during the scan to pause it.
- Do not move or use your mouse during auto unless paused.
- Automated scanning will only work properly if this program is being run as admin
- Automated scanning will scroll through your entire artifact inventory, filtering is applied on export
1. Follow the instructions under `How to prepare for scanning`
2. Scroll your artifact list so the **stars** for the **top row** and the **white/beige label** for the **bottom row** are **both fully visible** with some margin. ![something like this](https://github.com/D1firehail/AdeptiScanner-GI/blob/master/scroll-example.png?raw=true)
3. Press the `Start Auto` button
    - During the scan, you can press the escape button on your keyboard to pause it
    - `Resume` will make the scanner resume the scan
    - `Stop after processing` will make the scanner stop scrolling through new artifacts immediately, but finish processing all scanned ones
    - `Stop now` will make the scanner immediately exit automated scanning, not saving any scanner artifacts
4. The scanner will automatically stop once it thinks it's done scrolling through the artifact list or finds an artifact with identical stats to a previous one.
   - If this happens too early (for example, due to two artifacts being identical), you can manually scroll to the next screen and press `Start Auto`. Results of the previous run is not automatically deleted.

### Exporting results
1. Scan artifacts using manual, automatic scanning or a combination of the two
2. Configure the `Export Filters` section according to your wishes
    - You can use a template file that everything except artifact details will be copied from. To do this, place a GOOD-format json in the `ScannerFiles` folder and rename it to `ExportTemplate.json`    
    - If you wish, you can combine the artifacts of multiple GOOD-format jsons with the `Advanced` -> `Load Artifact File` button. There is no duplicate detection when doing this
3. Press the `Export Results` button, your results will be placed in a timestamped file in the `ScannerFiles` folder
    - You can change your export filters and press the export button more than once if you so wish, each export will appear as a separate file

## Special information when not running as admin or without Process handle features
<details>
  <summary> Click to expand</summary>
  
### Under these conditions, the following extra requirements apply
- Fullscreen-mode genshin is not supported
- The capture process cannot automatically switch focus to the game, as such the game window must not be covered during the capture process or any other feature that scans the game window
- To capture the game, it must be on your primary monitor, cover the middle of said screen , and have a visible white window header (can be "faked" using notepad or similar)
- Example image of meeting these conditions on a 1080p monitor

- I'm also in the [Genshin Optimizer Discord](https://discord.com/invite/CXUbQXyfUs). Feel free to @ me for smaller issues, but for longer things it's better to stick to the Genshin Dev discord or DMing me

## Acknowledgements
- Some functions used are heavily based on code from [WFInfo](https://github.com/WFCD/WFinfo), an OCR-based companion program for Warframe
- The tesseract model used was trained and provided by the creator of [this similar program](https://github.com/Andrewthe13th/Genshin_Scanner)
- The main purpose of this scanner is to more easily import your artifacts into [Genshin Optimizer](https://frzyc.github.io/genshin-optimizer/), but it should be compatible with any other program that uses the GOOD format
